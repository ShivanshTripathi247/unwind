I just wanted to feel heard.\"\n- Emotion: sadness, Entry: \"Now I just feel sad and distant from them.\"",
    "output": "It's so tough when you feel like the person closest to you isn't listening. That anger and sadness are completely justified. Before you revisit the conversation, could you take a moment for yourself? Find a quiet corner, and for two minutes, just focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor. It's a small way to ground yourself in the present."
